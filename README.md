# Here is a Python script that implements a basic file sharing app using the Python Flask framework:

This script sets up a Flask web application with two routes:

 - `/upload: Accepts a file upload and saves it to the uploads folder.

 - `/download/<filename>: Serves the requested file from the uploads folder for download.


To run the app, save the code in a Python file (e.g., app.py) and run it with the command python app.py.

Make sure to have the required dependencies installed (flask) before running the script.

Note: This is a basic implementation and does not include features like user authentication, file size limits, or advanced security measures. It's meant for demonstration purposes and should not be used in a production environment without further enhancements.
